# A place to write about my adventures in free software

I’ve been told I should start a blog for a while, but I would always put it off because I didn’t think I could keep up with it, or that people would read it. 

As it so happens, though, I’m terrible at keeping notes for my own sake, and maybe writing might help me fix that. So I figure at this point, I might as well try and write stuff down.  

Everything is subject to change!
